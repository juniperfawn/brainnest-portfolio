        <h3>Key - Professional Dreamer</h3>
        <p>
            I have always been a dreamer. Ever since I was little I had grand ideas and grand ways I imaginged

            and naratives with big ideas and visions for quality work.

        <h3>Studio & On Set Shooting</h3>
        <p>To me, portraiture is about taking care of people. I work very hard to create an environment that is
            comfortable,
            invlusive, and creative on every shoot. This allows both my subject and I to be our most creative selves.
